            <p class="lead mb-2">If you received an email with the address weirdly matching your entity and the
                domain
                is <code>@privaterelay.srakrn.me</code>, then the email should work fine as expected!</p>
            <p class="mb-2">This email is operated by <a href="https://srakrn.me">Sirakorn Lamyai</a>. The concept
                is
                that the emails get "tagged" from the receiver's address. This is to make sure that if any
                particular
                address gets leaked or sold
                to advertising agencies, he can filter them out accordingly.</p>

            <h2 class="display-4">FAQs</h2>
            <h4 class="lead">Q: Does this means anyone could randomly send emails to
                <code>@privaterelay.srakrn.me</code> and it will reach your inbox?
            </h4>
            <p>A: Well, no, the emails need to be whitelisted. You cannot assume that your company
                <code>WeirdCorp</code> can simply drop me a message at <code>weridcorp@privaterelay.srakrn.me</code>
            </p>
            <h4 class="lead">Q: This would not work with my email system due to some (insert technical terms here)!
            </h4>
            <p>A: No. The system is just plainly email forwarder, it should work in all cases.</code>
            </p>
            <h4 class="lead">Q: I get a response back from another <code>@privaterelay.srakrn.me</code> email, is that
                you?
            </h4>
            <p>Yes! While I hope I can reply to emails using the original alias I have asked you to send my emails to,
                it is not the case.
            </p>
            <h4 class="lead">Q: I want this! Can you share the architecture/infrastructure behind it?
            </h4>
            <p>Simply an <a href="https://forwardemail.net">Email forwarding service</a> to my personal Gmail account
                (along with weird Gmail tagging rules and some dirty scripts to create email aliases on the fly.)
            </p>
            <h4 class="lead">Q: I am a personal entity and instead of getting an "actual" email address, I got this
                private relay email instead.
            </h4>
            <p>Well, either (1) you did not get the email directly from me, or (2) I considered emails from you shold be
                tagged. Let's hope it's not the later case.</p>
